          <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.</p>
          <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps.</p>

          <p>
            Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.

          Where to start?
        </header>
        <p>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called:</p> <ul><li>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
        </li>
        <li>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
        </li>
        <li>
          Java Script.
        </li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML5">
          <header>HTML5</header>
        <p>This is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. <strong>HTML, or “HyperText Markup Language,”</strong> has been around in some form since roughly 1993, when it was created by physicist Tim Berners-Lee. It’s now in its fifth generation, HTML5. HTML isn’t a programming language, rather it’s a “Markup language.” It uses a syntax of tags to change the way text is displayed, for instance.</p><p>It can also define where images go on a page. What’s great is that HTML is relatively simple to learn. It provides a great place to start for people who don’t have experience with programming languages to learn the basics of coding. The following snippet shows the basic syntax of HTML.</p>
        <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
        </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
        <header>CSS</header>
        <p><strong>CSS or “Cascading Style Sheets”</strong> works with HTML to create the format for web pages. It works on top of the foundation of a page that was created with HTML. It also helps adapt pages to different formats optimized for desktops or mobile devices. The latest standard is CSS3, meaning they are in their third generation</p>
        <p>CSS is what gives websites their polished and professional look. It also allows for the addition of interactive elements like background color, headers, shapes, graphics, and more that make websites and web applications much more engaging to the viewer. Below is an example of basic CSS:</p>
        <code>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
            color: #333;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #007bff;
        }
        </code>
      </section>
        <p>There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.  </p>
      <section class="main-section" id="JAVASCRIPT">
        <header>
          JAVASCRIPT
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>JavaScript,</strong> which is often abbreviated to JS, is another front-end programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries like JQuery. Whereas HTML & CSS are used to control presentation, formatting, and layout, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different web elements. Below is a snippet of basic Javascript code;
        </p>
        <code>
        // Printing "Hello World!"
        function greet(name) {
            console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }

        greet("World");
        </code>
        <code>
            // Adding two numbers
            let num1 = 5;
            let num2 = 10;
            let sum = num1 + num2;
            console.log("The sum is: " + sum);
        </code>
        <code>
            // Displaying current date
            let currentDate = new Date();
            console.log("Today's date is: " + currentDate.toDateString());

        </code>
        <p>It is important to learn HTML and CSS before learning JavaScript, since HTML and CSS are the core technologies for building web pages and applications. HTML defines the structure of your content, CSS determines the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content interactive; therefore, it makes the most sense to learn them in that order. JavaScript incorporates valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python and C#.

          What is next?
        </header>
        <p>
          “What do I do next?”, “What are the next steps?”, “How do I proceed?”. These questions gest asked a lot of time by people who just started learning to code. It is suggested to choose something off-the-cuff to the person, depending on their background and interests. This article is intended to provide a more structured and detailed response to these Next Level questions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Having learned any one of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or your first programming language, the next step generally is to gain mastery of the language(s), build fun stuff, get mentorship, get an internship or an entry-level position where you can gain experience by working on live projects. Here are a few suggestions for the things you might want to do next.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn how to use Version Control Systems</li>
          <p>Version Control Systems (VCS) are used to track changes to your project files over time. They are useful to manage your projects and are an incredible collaborative tool when working in a team. You will be using them a lot in the future. Common examples are Git and Subversion.</p>
          <li>Dig deeper into HTML, CSS & JavaScript</li>
          <p>You have learnt a lot of HTML tags, CSS Selectors and rules, JavaScript Events and so on. This is the time to dig deeper into some concepts that might have been skipped in the beginner tutorials. You can start learning about CSS Transitions, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grids, CSS preprocessors (LESS and SASS).</p>
          <li>Keep Practicing</li>
          <p>
            Practice makes perfect. To develop a mastery of the syntax you have learnt, you need to constantly practice and apply the concepts you learn. Apart from the overused “todo lists”, you can build clones of applications that you commonly use. These two articles contain interesting ideas for projects that you can build. Pick up the projects that interest you one at a time and set a timeline for completing each project.

        <p>
          Once you've mastered these core basics of Web Development, now you've got to practice. And one of the best practices for web development or coding as a whole, is to build projects.<br>
          These are some of the projects you can build:
          <ul>
            <li>Chat application</li>
            <li>JavaScript calculator</li>
            <li>Hangman game</li>
            <li>Interactive forms</li>
            <li>JavaScript form validation</li>
          </ul>
          There are many more that you can choose from, find the ones that will challenge you and show your skill to the fullest.
